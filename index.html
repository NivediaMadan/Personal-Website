        <p>My favorite thing to do is to read. I love it!! The best time to read is before going to sleep. The book is so good it keeps you awake; not wanting to shut your eyes. Reading book after book after book; it never stops!<br><br> I am going to go in Grade 7 this September, so for this age group I recommend you read chapter books between 400-600 pages. Also it's better if the book doesn't have pictures so you can learn to visualize the story. Reading is a habit that can be done by everyone; you don't have to be smart to read! Read about the topics that you take interest in and use that to go on in life. In conclusion, reading is the best way to keep your mind learning. And you never know when you might learn something new. Keep Reading!!!</p>
